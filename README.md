# go-web-template
## Introduction
This project provides a basic template for starting a web project in Go.
It does not use any framework, nor is it a framework. It is just a project I use personally to provide
some boilerplate for starting new projects. It uses:
- The built-in template engine
- Chi as a router
- PostgreSQL as persistence layer (without an ORM)
